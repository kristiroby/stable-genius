# stable-genius
An application built using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js, Mongoose, Express and EJS. 

I started by making sure each of the seven restful routes were working with a minimal amount of data. Once each route was functional, I added the links to each page, and additional information and pages. The final step was to design the layout and styling.

Initially I struggled with understanding how the routes should be set up and how to connect all the pages to each other and show the correct information. I had some challenges with bugs, mostly from syntax errors, like missing a } or /. I'm happier with the design of this app than the previous.

Stable Genius is used by horse owners to track their horses' care and communicate with barn owners and barn managers.
It can also help barn owners and managers centralize information and communicate with each other.
